Project 3: ml_proxy

	A slightly more advanced proxy server. This proxy server does the basic work of forwarding an absolute HTTP request
		and returning the page served from the server with one exception. All JPEG imaged will be thinned.
	Thinned means that the image size will be shrunk before being returned. All incoming .jpg requests are forwarded
		via RPC calls to processes that download the image, and shrink it before returning it to the proxy to be
		returned to the client.
