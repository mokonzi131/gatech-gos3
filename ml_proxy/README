Project 3: ml_proxy

	A slightly more advanced proxy server. This proxy server does the basic work of forwarding an absolute HTTP request
		and returning the page served from the server with one exception. All JPEG imaged will be thinned.
	Thinned means that the image size will be shrunk before being returned. All incoming .jpg requests are forwarded
		via RPC calls to processes that download the image, and shrink it before returning it to the proxy to be
		returned to the client.

	This code is for CS 8803 (GOS) GaTech Fall 2012
	There are no copywrights, no usage restrictions, and no guarentees :)

JPEG Library:

	This code uses the lowres code provided and the jpeg library. Before doing anything else, change directory into the
		./jpeg-6b/ directory, and run "make clean" -- "make" and "gcc -c lowres.c lowres-write.c"
	This is essential so that the rest of the code can compile and run correctly.

To Build:

	./make bin

Other Make Commands:

	./make clean

To Run:

	./bin/proxy

usage: ./bin/proxy [-p port] [-w workers]

	[-p port] : valid (1-65535) port on which to listen (default is 50080)
	[-w workers] : a reasonable (1-50) number of worker threads to use (default is 5)
